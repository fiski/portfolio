                <p class="project-description">A redesign of Telia Sverige's subscription management portal (Mitt Telia),
                    enhancing the logged-in experience to match their new app and introducing
                    Telia-Familj - a feature that lets families view and select bonuses for all
                    members connected to their household. This first-to-market solution simplified
                    bonus management for Telia's customers while setting a new industry standard.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="body-text">Mitt Telia's legacy infrastructure presented a unique challenge where
                    straightforward design solutions often encountered technical limitations. The
                    project required constant collaboration between design and development to find
                    solutions that improved user experience while respecting system constraints.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The main challenge in designing Telia-familj was creating a simple user
                    experience for complex household bonus scenarios. When multiple family members
                    have active bonuses, how do we clearly communicate the impact of changing these
                    selections? The design needed to guide users through these decisions while
                    keeping the interface intuitive and preventing confusion.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body-text">The design process combined regular team testing with customer interviews,
                    ensuring solutions worked both technically and for end users. External feedback
                    Was particularly valuable in understanding how families would interact with the
                    new bonus selection feature, as well as hearing their preferences and wishes for
                    what kinds of bonuses they hoped to receive.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body-text">The redesign aligned selected pages with Telia's new app design language, while
                    other sections received focused improvements to information hierarchy and
                    content structure. This phased approach, guided by stakeholder priorities,
                    allowed for meaningful improvements even where full redesigns weren't
                    implemented.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body-text">Designing this new bonus management feature required careful consideration of
                    various user scenarios and edge cases. While family creation remained tied to
                    legacy systems, the rest of the interface followed Telia's new design language.
                    Key focus was placed on handling complex situations like simultaneous bonus
                    selections and new user onboarding, ensuring a smooth experience regardless of
                    user circumstances.</p>

                <p class="body-text">The project successfully modernized key areas of Mitt Telia while introducing
                    Telia-Familj - the company's first household bonus management feature. By
                    carefully balancing design improvements with technical constraints, the project
                    delivered an intuitive interface that simplified complex family bonus scenarios.
                    The new design aligned with Telia's app experience, setting a foundation for
                    future portal improvements while providing customers with a clearer way to
                    manage their household benefits.</p>
