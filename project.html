                    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                    <p>Over the course of several rounds of review and iteration, I refined an approach to the website gathering input
                        from
                        stakeholders and developers along the way. I designed the UI for desktop, tablet and smartphone breakpoints. Key
                        interactions were designed and prototyped as a spec for the development team as well as a tool to evaluate
                        usability
                        during the usability study.
