                    planning car
                    manufacturing schedules. The project focused on transforming key aspects of a
                    complex legacy system into an intuitive, modern interface that aligns with
                    Volvo's design principles while improving efficiency for global production

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The existing manufacturing planning software, developed in the 1990s, presented a unique starting point. Two separate
                    keyboard-only systems were in use - one for Gothenburg and another for Volvo's global plants. The complex legacy
                    interface, with its steep learning curve and navigation challenges, needed a strategic approach for modernization.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>For the MVP phase, we focused on the most frequently used features, aiming to transform them into an intuitive
                    interface (mouse-enabled, of course). A key challenge emerged in redesigning the user flow, as the original software
                    lacked clear navigation structure and location indicators. This initial release establishes the foundation for
                    future iterations, which will incorporate additional features based on user feedback and business priorities.</p>

                </div>
                <p>One of the key approaches was breaking down the complex system into manageable
                    segments, analysing each workflow's functionality by asking questions like
                    "okay, so this is where you do X and Y. Does it connect to any other workflow
                    further away in time or is this it?". This iterative approach allowed for
                    focused improvements while maintaining system integrity and ensuring each
                    redesigned segment met user requirements effectively.

                <p>With no established design system for internal enterprise software at Volvo, we
                    leveraged AG-Grid's enterprise data grid library as our foundation. This
                    provided a robust framework for our table-heavy interface needs, while allowing
                    us to apply Volvo's visual identity. The approach balanced efficiency with
                    consistency, requiring only minimal custom component development while
                    maintaining a cohesive Volvo look and feel.

                <p>Since there aren't many users of the system, we had the advantage of direct

                    making the development process more focused and efficient. No need for deeper
                    studies or extensive user research methods when working with a small, accessible
                    user group.

                    modern, intuitive interface while preserving essential workflows. Through direct
                    dialogue when needed with the small user group, we created a solution that not
                    only improved efficiency but also set a new standard for internal software at
                    Volvo. The redesigned system maintains the robustness required for global
                    manufacturing planning while providing a more accessible and visually consistent
                    experience that aligns with Volvo's quality standards. This foundation now
