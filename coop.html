                </div>
                <p class="body-text">Coop Sverige AB's outdated supplier portal suffered from low user adoption due
                    to its difficult interface and lack of actionable insights. This resulted in
                    missed sales opportunities for both Coop and their suppliers. The goal was to
                    create Coop Insights - a modern platform that would help suppliers identify
                    trends, track real-time sales data, and make informed decisions based on
                    customer behavior.

                    which features should be included in the MVP and what could be developed later.
                    The process explored responsive layouts across desktop, tablet, and smartphone
                    breakpoints, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

                    modern, intuitive interface while preserving essential workflows. Through direct
                    dialogue when needed with the small user group, we created a solution that not
                    only improved efficiency but also set a new standard for internal software at
                    Volvo. The redesigned system maintains the robustness required for global
                    manufacturing planning while providing a more accessible and visually consistent
                    experience that aligns with Volvo's quality standards. This foundation now
                    serves as a stepping stone for future iterations and improvements based on
